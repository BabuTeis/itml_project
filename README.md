# Project Title: Introduction to Machine Learning (for AI) Project

https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_species_distributions.html#sklearn.datasets.fetch_species_distributions

## Repository Overview
This repository contains all the necessary files, models, and scripts for the project submission. It includes:
- Source code for the model implementation and training.
- Datasets used for training and testing.
- Analysis scripts and results.
- Final written report in PDF format.

## To-Do List
1. **Complete the Report**:
   - Ensure the report is between 3-10 pages.
   - Clearly describe what is new vs. reused code (cite reused material properly).
   - Include detailed results, analysis, and explanations for any model failure.
   - Add references to figures/tables in the report.

2. **Validate Model Training**:
   - Confirm proper use of training, validation, and test datasets.
   - Ensure overfitting is detected and addressed where necessary.
   - Document any preprocessing steps taken.

3. **Organize Repository**:
   - Ensure all source code is organized and includes comments where necessary.
   - Provide clear citations for reused code or datasets in the appropriate files.
   - Attach the source code files to the report for submission.

4. **Reproducibility Check**:
   - Verify that the steps to reproduce the project results are clear in the report.
   - Test scripts to ensure they run as expected.

## Submission Instructions
- Finalize all project components by **January 21, 2025** (flexible until January 31).
- Submit the written report (PDF) and attach all source code files.

## Notes
- The project should reflect approximately 40 hours of work.
- Ensure compliance with the evaluation rubric (quality, model training, report structure).
